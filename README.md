Assemble composes arrays of functions that pick from and assign to a given type (assembling it).
The composed "assembly" is like a pipe that steps through each function, merging input with any
returned props and passing it to the next, returning the assembled result. Common use cases would be
applying a sequence of functions to app state, DB or API results.

The focus of Assemble is to encourage an approach to function composition that is versatile yet
simple to reason about and is type-safe with minimal definition overhead.

### Hello World

This sample shows two "assemblers" operating on a props type. These functions benefit from type
hinting for the props they can access and if defined, the props they need to return.

```ts
import { assemble, Assembler, VoidAssembler } from '@os-gurus/assemble'

interface Props {
  name: string
  message?: string
}

const prepareMessage: Assembler<Props, 'message'> = ({ name }) => {
  return { message: `Hello ${name}` }
}
// ‚òùÔ∏è Must return { message }

const logMessage: VoidAssembler<Props> = ({ message }) => {
  console.log(message)
}
// ‚òùÔ∏è Must return void

const sayHello = assemble(prepareMessage, logMessage)

sayHello({ name: 'World' })
// üñ®Ô∏è "Hello World"
```

### Assembler Functions

The `Assembler`, `PartialAssembler` and `VoidAssembler` type utilities define functions that can
be given to `assemble` and declare the props type they will operate on.
- `Assembler` functions return a subset of props, as defined by keys given to the utility.
- `PartialAssembler` functions optionally return a subset of props as defined.
- `VoidAssembler` functions return void, but can use the props, e.g. for logging or sending.

Note, you don't have to use these utilities. Any function signature can be given to `assemble` as
long as it accepts a single props object argument and returns either a subset of props or nothing.

Examples of generated function definitions:

```ts
type Props = { message?: string, name?: string }

Assembler<Props, 'message'>
// ‚û• (props: Props) => { message: string }

Assembler<Props, 'name' | 'message'>
// ‚û• (props: Props) => { message: string, name: string }

PartialAssembler<Props, 'message'>
// ‚û• (props: Props) => { message?: string }

VoidAssembler<Props>
// ‚û• (props: Props) => void
```

### Async Assemblers

`AsyncAssembler` works exactly as `Assembler` for asynchronous functions and `assemble` can compose
a mixture of async and sync assemblers. As do `AsyncPartialAssembler` and `AsyncVoidAssembler`.

`assembleSync` can be used to enforce synchronous functions and a non-promise return.

```ts
import fetch from 'node-fetch'
import { assemble, Assembler, AsyncAssembler, VoidAssembler } from '@os-gurus/assemble'

interface Props {
  name?: string
  message?: string
}

const fetchName: AsyncAssembler<Props, 'name'> = async () => {
  const { results } = await fetch('https://randomuser.me/api').then(res => res.json())
  const { title, first } = results[0].name
  return { name: `${title} ${first}` }
}

const prepareMessage: Assembler<Props, 'message'> = ({ name }) => {
  return { message: `Hello ${name}` }
}

const logMessage: VoidAssembler<Props> = ({ message }) => {
  console.log(message)
}

const sayHello = assemble(fetchName, prepareMessage, logMessage)

sayHello({})
// üñ®Ô∏è  "Hello {RANDOM_NAME}"
```

---

### Mixing Function Types

Assemble will accept a range of function types and create an input type that merges all function
prop types, while also returning the intersection of all input and assigned props. It can even take
anonymous functions that are typed inline.

```ts
import { assembleSync, Assembler } from '@os-gurus/assemble'

type NumberProps = { one?: boolean, two?: boolean }
type LetterProps = { a?: boolean, b?: boolean }

const assignOne: Assembler<NumberProps, 'one'> = () => ({ one: true })
const assignA: Assembler<LetterProps, 'a'> = () => ({ a: true })

const mixedAssembly = assembleSync(
  assignOne,
  assignA,
  () => ({ foo: true }),
)
// ‚û• Param { a?: boolean, b?: boolean, one?: boolean, two?: boolean }
// ‚òùÔ∏è All function prop types are merged into one

mixedAssembly({})
// ‚û• Returns { a: boolean, b?: boolean, foo: boolean, one: boolean, two?: boolean }
// ‚òùÔ∏è Given assemblers provide `a` and `one` so they're no longer optional
// üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Note `foo` wasn't in prop types but is inferred from the inline function

mixedAssembly({ b: true })
// ‚û• Returns { a: boolean, b: true, foo: boolean, one: boolean, two?: boolean }
// ‚òùÔ∏è `b` is given so its prop type is narrowed to its literal value (true)
```

### Known Issues

**Merged type constraints override**

Using `MergeUnion` on function's input and prop types to cast the return type of `assemble` creates
a type error. Because 'Returned' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint '{}'.
It is overridden by first casting to `unknown`. It can also be avoided by not merging props into one
type and instead returning a union of all props, but that becomes unreadable for assemblies that
have more than a few functions.

It would be nice to have a solution that avoids override casting, because there's a potential for it
to return a different type at run time, which could cause false positive type checks.

**Input shouldn't allow extra props**

The `Input` type on `assemble` extends the `Props` type, but it should be more of an alias than an
extension. The reason it's defined as a new type instead of just using `Props` is to tighten the
return type by assigning whatever props are given as known literals instead of conditionals. The
problem is that by extending, the `Input` type allows more props to be given than exist in `Props`.

The type hinting works well to suggest input props, but there should be a type error when giving
props that aren't defined in `Props`. That would ease maintenance of compositions by making it
obvious when props are given that are no longer required by its functions.

**Does not infer mutable props**

The `assemble` return type merges the union of assembler props, assemble input and assembler returns
in that order. However, the input type is narrowed because it is given explicitly, which overrides
its wider type in the props.

e.g. An `Assembler` returns `{ a: boolean }` but `assemble` is given `{ a: true }`, the return type
will be `{ a: true }` ‚Äî In this case the assembler could override input and set `{ a: false }` and
the return type would be wrong.

It would be nice if it was possible for the assigned `AssembledProps` type to override the input
even though it's wider, it would be safer.
